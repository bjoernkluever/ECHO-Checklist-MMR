<h1>ECHO Proposal Quality‑Assurance Checklist - Myanmar HIP 2026</h1>
<h2>ECHO Proposal Quality‑Assurance Checklist - Myanmar HIP 2026</h2>

<p>Use this checklist to quality‑assure proposals before submission to DG ECHO. It integrates rejection reasons shared and the Myanmar‑specific provisions of the 2026 HIP and Technical Annex.</p>

<h3>A. Needs Assessment & Evidence Base</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Is the needs assessment comprehensive, contextualized, recent, and disaggregated (quantitative and qualitative)?</li>
  <li>Is the analysis specific to the proposed geographic area and population groups (not generic), and does it directly justify the action?</li>
  <li>Are vulnerabilities and target groups evidenced with sources and dates, and aligned to the most acute needs?</li>
  <li>Is humanitarian advocacy grounded in coordinated, evidence‑based analysis?</li>
  <li>Where feasible/safe, is there consultation or coordination with relevant authorities; if not, is a clear justification provided?</li>
</ul>

<h3>B. Response Analysis & Strategy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Is there a coherent, detailed implementation strategy (methodology, sequencing, delivery mechanisms, targeting, monitoring)?</li>
  <li>Is the response logic fully aligned with the logical framework (results, outputs, indicators, assumptions)?</li>
  <li>Are operational/protection/access/contextual risks clearly analyzed with concrete mitigation measures?</li>
  <li>If working through community/camp management committees or local structures, are risks (e.g., exclusion, elite capture) and mitigations explicit?</li>
  <li>Are conflict‑sensitivity and Do No Harm considerations integrated and tracked?</li>
</ul>

<h3>C. Alignment With ECHO Policies & Myanmar HIP 2026</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Does the intervention focus on life‑saving multi‑sector assistance for IDPs, conflict‑affected and disaster‑affected populations (incl. hard‑to‑reach areas)?</li>
  <li>Are sector choices aligned with Myanmar HIP 2026 priorities: protection (incl. mine action/IHL dissemination/GBV/CAAC/PSS), food/basic needs, health and nutrition, shelter/NFIs, WASH, emergency multi‑sector assistance, and EiE (return to learning via temporary opportunities)?</li>
  <li>Is localisation a core feature (fair partnerships, capacity strengthening, risk sharing, adequate share of overheads to local partners)?</li>
  <li>Is there coordination and clear complementarity with FLER/emergency mechanisms, and cluster/Area of Responsibility reporting?</li>
  <li>Are Minimum Environmental Requirements (MER) applied across sectors, including WASH and Shelter & Settlements designs?</li>
  <li>Is the proposal free of standalone DP components in Myanmar (2026 targeted DP budget is not allocated to Myanmar) while mainstreaming preparedness where relevant?</li>
  <li>Does the proposal operationalise the Nexus where appropriate without diluting the life‑saving focus?</li>
</ul>

<h3>D. Proposal Structure, Detail & Internal Coherence</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Is the proposal well‑structured and complete (Single Form sections fully detailed, no vague descriptions)?</li>
  <li>Are activities, logframe elements, and budget internally consistent across all sections?</li>
  <li>Are indicators SMART, time‑bound, and aligned with DG ECHO Key Result Indicators (KRIs) where applicable (avoid custom if a KRI exists)?</li>
  <li>Is the DG ECHO Protection Mainstreaming KOI (PMKOI) applied across sectors, and a Protection outcome indicator included for protection actions?</li>
  <li>Are abbreviations, methodologies, and technical concepts clearly explained?</li>
</ul>

<h3>E. Results Framework Quality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Are intended results clearly defined, realistic, and derived from the needs assessment?</li>
